<h5>Research</h5>
<p>
  My research examines the relationship between <strong>democracy, inequality, and political communication</strong>. 
  I study how parties compete for votes, respond to social and economic challenges, and communicate with citizens — 
  and how these processes shape political participation, civic engagement, political representation, 
  and the functioning of democratic systems. 
</p>
<h5>Political communication</h5>
<p>
  A large share of my work investigates how parties compete for attention and how citizens respond to political 
  communication. This includes research on negative campaigning, issue and group appeals, and the role of media 
  and social media in shaping responsiveness. I am also interested in the consequences of communication 
  strategies for polarization, accountability, and perceptions of democracy.
</p>

<h5>Inequality</h5>
<p>
  I study how political actors address economic, social, and legal inequalities. 
  Recent projects track party positions on equality across advanced democracies, 
  showing how programmatic commitments have changed over time. 
  I also examine how institutional and elite choices influence distributive politics, 
  and how inequalities are reinforced or challenged through law, policy, and political action.
</p>

<h5>Democracy and participation</h5>
<p>
  My research also explores democratic innovations and participatory processes. 
  This includes work on deliberative mini-publics such as the Good Council for Redistribution, 
  where I analyze both <em>who</em> participates and <em>how participation affects</em> attitudes, 
  knowledge, and civic engagement. In addition to studying these processes, I have also worked on 
  the practical side of <strong>sortition</strong>, developing methods for the fair and transparent 
  selection of participants in citizen assemblies and other deliberative forums. 
  More broadly, I investigate how new forms of participation can enhance 
  representation and democratic legitimacy.
</p>

<p>
  Across these projects, I combine <strong>quantitative and computational methods</strong> with 
  original data collection and applied research. I approach both academic and policy-oriented work 
  with the same methodological rigor, aiming to advance theory while contributing to practical debates 
  on the future of democracy.
